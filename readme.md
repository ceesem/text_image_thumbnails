## Requirements

The notebook requires pandas and xlrd to read the excel file, Pillow to create image files, and tqdm to show a progress bar. Once you make a new python enviornment, run the following command:

```
pip install pandas Pillow xlrd tqdm
```

## Notes

The font locations assume MacOS defaults and would need to be updated for any other system.
